Astronomy Quiz

“Astronomy Quiz” is a group project made for Android Compose Camp , an app making project competition arranged by Google Developer Student Club of MKSSS’s Cummins College of Engineering, Pune.

Problem Statement :

The main objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface to help people who are interested in Astronomy to test their knowledge and in the process, gain more information about the subject. 

Programming Language: Kotlin

Proposed Solution: 
The main requirement of the application is to find questions and answers. In this application, the user is instantly directed towards the first question of the quiz. Here, the user can select his or her answers and see whether they are right or wrong. If they are wrong, they will be able to see the correct option as well. After completion of the project, the user will get to see the total number of questions they have solved it correctly and whether they have passed the quiz or not.
